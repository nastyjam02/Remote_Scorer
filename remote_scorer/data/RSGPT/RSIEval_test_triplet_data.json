A road runs diagonally across the center, intersecting another road that divides the image into quadrants. Vehicles, including cars and trucks, are parked along the roads and within some courtyards. Trees are sparsely distributed among the buildings, adding small patches of green. The background consists mainly of the rooftops and streets, creating a dense urban texture. The overall color palette includes muted tones of gray, white, and occasional green from vegetation."
